- Pain points: ECDSA vulnerability uncertainty, PQC complexity, need for expert guidance

**Messaging Strategy:**
- Lead with: "ECDSA clock is ticking" + "understand your vulnerability"
- Social proof: Ethereum Foundation endorsement + technical specifics
- Value prop: Learn directly from quantum physicists + prototype quantum-safe protocols

**Key Keywords They Search:**
- Post-quantum cryptography web3
- ECDSA quantum threat
- Quantum blockchain security
- Quantum safe cryptography
- Post-quantum signatures Ethereum
- Hybrid signatures blockchain
- Quantum computing cryptography
- Blockchain security 2026

**Outreach Channels:**

**Sample Social Post (Twitter/X):**

```
ECDSA won't last forever.

Google estimates quantum computers capable of breaking current blockchain 
signatures in 5-15 years. Yet <1% of web3 builders have talked to a quantum 
physicist about it.

Quredge changes that. Join quantum researchers for a month at Edge City. 
Learn PQC. Prototype quantum-safe protocols. Ship.

Subject: Quredge: Web3 Builders x Quantum Physicists (May-June 2026)

Hi [Name],

Most web3 builders know ECDSA is vulnerable to quantum computers eventually. 
Few actually know what to do about it.

Quredge is different. We're bringing quantum physicists + Ethereum researchers + 
web3 builders together for a month. Goal: understand the threat, design quantum-safe 
protocols, and ship prototypes.

Why this matters:
- NIST finalized PQC standards (Aug 2022) — adoption race is ON
- First mover advantage: protocols designed now shape the next decade
- Hybrid signatures + L2 scaling + new governance models
- Meet Ethereum core devs + quantum teams from IBM/Google/IonQ

What you'll do:
- Deep dives on post-quantum cryptography from NIST researchers
- Design sessions on ECDSA migration paths
- Hands-on: build proof-of-concept quantum-safe signature schemes
- Network with 8-10 other top builders + 5 institutional investors

Cost: Sliding scale ($0-5K based on ability). Housing + meals included.

Interested? Apply here [link] by Feb 28.

Looking forward,
Quredge Team

- Web3 builders need to grasp quantum threat + cryptographic solutions (artists help)
- Historical precedent: Feynman diagrams, Tesla's visualization, nature-inspired AI
- Urgent moment: Quantum computing + blockchain security decisions happening NOW

What we offer:
- Fully funded month (housing, meals, stipend)
- Collaborate directly with quantum physicists from national labs
- Access to 200+ web3 developers + 5 institutional investors
- Opportunity to create: frameworks, visualizations, publications, artworks
- Network effect: Past Edge City alumni (12K+) stay connected long-term

Expected outcomes:
- Published frameworks on quantum + cryptography
- Artwork/exhibition documenting residency
- Long-term collaborations with scientists + builders
- Funding opportunities (grants, commissions, grants)
