## NEW SECTION: "WHY 2026 MATTERS"

**Add this section mid-page (SEO boost + credibility)**

```markdown
## The 2026 Inflection Point: Why Now?

### 1. Post-Quantum Cryptography Goes from Theory to Reality
- **NIST finalized PQC standards (Aug 2022)** — standards are now stable
- **ECDSA vulnerability window: 5-15 years** per Google/IBM quantum timelines
- **Blockchain exposure:** ECDSA secures $2T+ in digital assets
- **Adoption race:** First-movers in quantum-safe infrastructure gain competitive advantage

### 2. Quantum Computing Breaks into Commercial Use Cases
- **Market growth:** $1.5B (2023) → $8B (2027) — 500% expansion in 4 years
- **Real applications emerging:** Financial optimization, molecular simulation, logistics
- **Hybrid quantum-classical computing:** AI acceleration TAM = $50B+ by 2030
- **Venture funding:** $1B+ in 2024 alone — capital following capability

### 3. Talent Pipeline Bottleneck
- **Job explosion:** 157,000+ quantum sector jobs projected by 2045
- **Supply gap:** Only 500-1,000 PhD quantum researchers graduate annually globally
- **First-mover advantage:** Teams assembled now define quantum's next decade
- **Residency model:** Meet and network with researchers who'll be in leadership in 5 years

### 4. Web3 + Quantum Convergence Unlocks New Opportunities
- **Post-quantum blockchain:** Ethereum, Bitcoin exploring PQC integration
- **Distributed quantum computing:** Blockchain infrastructure for quantum resource access
- **Cryptographic innovation:** New signature schemes, zero-knowledge proofs, governance models
- **Emerging sector:** None of the major protocols have quantum-safe strategies yet — first-mover advantage exists

---

**The move:** Ideas shaped in May 2026 will influence blockchain security, quantum infrastructure, 
and cryptographic standards for the next decade.
```

### WHY THIS WORKS
- ✅ **SEO keywords:** Post-quantum cryptography, ECDSA, quantum computing market, hybrid computing, web3 security
- ✅ **Urgency:** Multiple credible reasons (standards finalized, vulnerability windows, market growth)
- ✅ **Market validation:** Cites specific numbers (5-15 years, $8B market, 157K jobs)
- ✅ **Relevance to all audiences:** Researchers (talent gap), builders (adoption race), VCs (market growth), philosophers (convergence)

## NEW SECTION: FAQ (REDUCES FRICTION + TARGETS KEYWORDS)

```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

### Technical Questions

**Q: Will quantum computing actually break blockchain?**
A: Eventually, yes—but not immediately. Quantum computers capable of breaking ECDSA (Shor's algorithm) 
likely arrive in 5-15 years per Google and IBM timelines. Post-quantum cryptography protects against this. 
At Quredge, you'll learn the timeline, the threat landscape, and the solutions being deployed now.

**Q: What is post-quantum cryptography exactly?**
A: PQC uses mathematical problems believed to resist quantum attacks (e.g., lattice problems, multivariate 
polynomials). NIST standardized three families: **ML-KEM** (key establishment), **ML-DSA** (signatures), 
**SLH-DSA** (backup). Ethereum and Bitcoin researchers are exploring hybrid approaches that combine 
ECDSA + PQC for backward compatibility.

**Q: What is distributed quantum computing?**
A: Instead of a single quantum computer, distribute quantum resources across a network (via blockchain 
or similar protocols). Enables privacy-preserving computation, decentralized access to quantum hardware, 
and new governance models for shared quantum infrastructure.

**Q: Do I need blockchain experience to apply?**
A: No. Curiosity matters more than credentials. Web3 builders will have deep blockchain knowledge; 
quantum physicists will teach the cryptography. The residency works because you learn across domains.

**Q: Do I need a quantum computing background?**
A: For the research track, yes—PhD or equivalent. For the web3 track, no blockchain background needed. 
For the VC track, no technical background required—you'll have domain experts on-site.

---

### Logistics Questions

**Q: What's included in the residency?**
A: Housing (shared or private, ~$2-4K/month), meals, community spaces, mentorship from quantum/web3 
experts, access to investor network, and collaboration stipend. Not included: flights, optional outings.

**Q: What's the cost for participants?**
A: Research track: Fully funded (travel + living). Web3 builder track: Sliding scale ($0-5K based on 
ability). VC/investor track: $10K sponsorship package (includes network access).

**Q: How many people attend?**
A: Cohort size: 25 total. Mix: ~10 quantum researchers, ~8 web3 builders, ~5 investors/advisors, 
~2 artists/philosophers. Intentionally small for high-trust collaboration.

**Q: When do applications close?**
A: Early applications: Jan 15 - Feb 28 (priority spots). Final applications: Mar 1 - Mar 31. 
Cohort finalized Apr 15.

---

### Impact Questions

**Q: What should I expect as an outcome?**
A: Depends on track. Researchers: Collaborative papers, code repositories, new research directions. 
Builders: Prototype quantum-safe protocols, design partnerships, investor connections. VCs: Deep 
conviction on quantum computing market, deal flow, founder relationships. Artists: New frameworks, 
publications, network of scientists.

**Q: Can I bring a cofounder or colleague?**
A: Encouraged. Many past Edge City participants attend with co-founders or research partners. 
Apply together if possible.

**Q: What's the alumni network like?**
A: Past Edge City cohorts (12K+ participants) stay connected via Telegram, GitHub, and annual 
reunions. Quredge alumni will have dedicated quantum + web3 Discord for ongoing collaboration.
