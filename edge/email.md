We are bringing quantum to the Edge City landscape, in the next edition of Edge Esmeralda. Edge City is defined as a social incubator, and it's valuable from many angles.

From the research perspective, it's a pretty unique multidisciplinary scenario, with a sufficient duration and interaction opportunities between all residencies, participants and stakeholders, to virtually become lab for this month (what i'm more excited about is to work side-by-side with other communities understanding and bridging quantum to pains/needs/open-problems).

From the business side, Edge City is an incubator, with a proven sucess track. In the quantum landscape, there're currently no incubators like these (only hackathons, or dedicated programs, but nothing as multidisciplinary and putting investors side-by-side with entrepreneurs, coders, engineers, researchers).

From the social & community perspective, Edge seems to provide an interesting seed to create a community. While the scope of Edge and community is wider than web3 & blockchain, one of the goals of this residency program is to understand whether there should be a room for a dedicated blockchain-quantum-workforce, focusing beyond post-quantum crypto (say, modelling, optimization, sensing applied to open-problems in the blockchain).

We believe the quantum residency at Edge (quredge) is timely. You can find more information at https://quantum-residency-edge-city-production.up.railway.app/ or reach out if you want to discuss partnership opportunities, participation, or just learn more about what we're building.
