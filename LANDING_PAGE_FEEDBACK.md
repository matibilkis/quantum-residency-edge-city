## ⚠️ Areas for Improvement Before Sponsor Outreach

### 1. Missing Concrete Outcomes (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Current State**: 
- Uses Edge City's overall stats ($250M+ raised, 12,000+ participants)
- No Quredge-specific metrics or outcomes

**Recommendations**:
- **Option A**: Clearly label stats as "Edge City Track Record" (adds context)
- **Option B**: Add Quredge-specific metrics if available:
  - "Expected cohort size: 25-50 quantum researchers & builders"
  - "Target outcomes: 5+ collaborative papers, 10+ proof-of-concepts"
  - "Network access: 1000+ Edge Esmeralda participants across 25+ residencies"

**Why it matters**: Sponsors want to know what they're specifically supporting, not just the broader Edge City ecosystem.

### 2. Sponsor Section Needs More Specificity (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Current State**:
- Tiers say "Contact for details" (no price ranges)
- Benefits are qualitative ("Premium placement", "Direct connections")
- No concrete ROI metrics

**Recommendations**:
- **Add expected ROI metrics**:
  - "Access to 50+ quantum researchers and frontier tech builders"
  - "10+ startup pitches and demo day presentations"
  - "5+ dedicated networking sessions"
  - "Priority access to research collaborations"
- **Consider adding price ranges** (even broad ones like "$5K-$50K+ depending on tier")
- **Add "Why Now?" section** highlighting:
  - Quantum computing inflection point (commercial applications emerging)
  - Post-quantum cryptography urgency (5-15 year window)
  - Talent gap (157K quantum jobs needed by 2045)

**Why it matters**: Sponsors need concrete ROI to justify budget allocation.

### 3. Missing Team/Organizer Credibility (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current State**:
- No "About the Team" or "Organizers" section
- No advisory board or scientific committee mentioned
- Partnership logos (QutSur, UAB Cruïlla) are present but could be more prominent

**Recommendations**:
- **Add "About Quredge" section** with:
  - Organizer bios (who's running this?)
  - Advisory board or scientific committee (if available)
  - Institutional partnerships (make QutSur, UAB Cruïlla more prominent)
- **Add "Why Quredge?" section** differentiating from:
  - Quantum hackathons (too short, superficial)
  - University programs (too long, siloed)
  - Conferences (too brief, no deep collaboration)

**Why it matters**: Sponsors invest in people and credibility, not just concepts.

### 4. Application Timeline Clarity (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current State**:
- Landing page says "Applications open March 2026"
- Event is May 30 - June 27, 2026
- No visual timeline

**Recommendations**:
- **Add timeline graphic**:
  ```
  Now → March 2026: Applications Open
  March-April 2026: Selection Process
  May 30 - June 27, 2026: Residency
  ```
- **Clarify sponsor deadlines**: "Sponsor spots limited - secure by [date]"

**Why it matters**: Creates urgency and helps sponsors plan.

### 5. Call-to-Action Optimization (LOW PRIORITY)

**Current State**:
- "Stay tuned!" button works for participants
- Sponsor CTAs are good but lack urgency

**Recommendations**:
- **Add urgency to sponsor section**: "Limited sponsor spots available - 5 Founding Sponsor positions"
- **Consider A/B testing**: "Partner With Us" vs "Secure Your Spot"
- **Add social proof to CTAs**: "Join 10+ leading quantum companies already committed"

**Why it matters**: Urgency drives action, especially for sponsors with budget cycles.

### 6. Missing Testimonials/Case Studies (LOW PRIORITY)

**Current State**:
- No testimonials from quantum researchers
- No case studies from past Edge City quantum participants (if any)

**Recommendations**:
- **Add "What Participants Say" section** (if you have any Edge City alumni in quantum)
- **Add "Expected Outcomes" section** with specific examples:
  - "Collaborative paper on quantum sensing for neurotech"
  - "Startup pitch: Quantum optimization for blockchain"
  - "Proof-of-concept: Quantum ML for drug discovery"

**Why it matters**: Social proof from peers is powerful for both participants and sponsors.
