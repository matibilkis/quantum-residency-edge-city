# Physics & Philosophy | Quantum Foundations & Philosophy

Why quantum cryptography works: Deep understanding of uncertainty, 
measurement, and the nature of distributed systems.

For researchers seeking to bridge theory and real-world impact. Collaborate 
with web3 architects on the philosophical implications of post-quantum 
signatures and distributed quantum computing. Explore why metaphors matter 
in quantum application discovery.

# web3 Ecosystem | Web3 Security & Post-Quantum Cryptography

Quantum and web3 communities rarely intersect. Learn post-quantum 
cryptography directly from quantum physicists, explore hybrid signature 
schemes, and build quantum-safe protocols together.

Understand the cryptographic underpinnings of decentralized identity, 
governance, and L2 scaling in a quantum-aware world—through deep 
collaboration across disciplines.

# Edge City Model | Transdisciplinary Convergence

Unlike conferences (one week, surface-level) or universities (multi-year, 
isolated), Quredge offers one month of intensive, high-trust collaboration 
where ideas become reality.

Scientists, builders, artists, and investors live together, cook together, 
create together. Past Edge City cohorts generated 200+ projects, $1M+ in 
grants, and lasting collaborations that continue years later.
