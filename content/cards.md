# Physics & Philosophy | Quantum Foundations & Philosophy

At least two faces of quantum physics are extremely overlapping Edge
Cityʼs scope: technology and philosophy implications. Many questions on
these quantum topics have remained open for a while (maybe a century
by now) and thatʼs a very effective curiosity spark spanning so many
communities. But many other questions have recently been answered;
particularly in the tech field: is the second quantum revolution
happening? Absolutely yes.

# web3 Ecosystem | Web3 Security & Post-Quantum Cryptography

Ethereum is way more than sending money through a
blockchain. Quantum tech is also way more than solving discrete
logarithm problems (potentially breaking some massively adopted
cryptographic protocols such as RSA, ECC, and giving rise to a
whole field coined post-quantum cryptography, which is not little).
Yet, Ethereum lacks a quantum workforce that both identifies,
develops and provides solutions with quantum technologies (that
go well beyond cryptographic applications). Is there room for an
interdisciplinary Quantum Ethereum workforce?

# Edge City Model | Transdisciplinary Convergence

Unlike conferences (one week, surface-level) or universities (multi-year, 
isolated), Quredge offers one month of intensive, high-trust collaboration 
where ideas become reality.

Scientists, builders, artists, and investors live together, cook together, 
create together. Past Edge City cohorts generated 200+ projects, $1M+ in 
grants, and lasting collaborations that continue years later.
