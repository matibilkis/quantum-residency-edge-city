# Physics & Philosophy | Quantum Foundations & Philosophy

Why quantum cryptography matters: Deep understanding of uncertainty, 
measurement, and the nature of distributed systems.

Perfect for researchers 
seeking to bridge theory and application. Collaborate with web3 architects 
on the philosophical implications of post-quantum signatures and distributed 
quantum computing architectures.

# web3 Ecosystem | Web3 Security & Post-Quantum Cryptography

The clock is ticking on ECDSA. Learn post-quantum cryptography from quantum 
physicists, explore hybrid signature schemes, and build quantum-safe protocols 
with Ethereum researchers. 

Understand the cryptographic underpinnings of 
decentralized identity, governance, and L2 scaling in a quantum-aware world.

# Edge City Model | Transdisciplinary Model

Unlike conferences (1 week, surface talks) or universities (multi-year, 
isolated projects), Quredge offers 30 days of intensive, high-trust 
collaboration. 

Scientists, builders, artists, and investors live together, 
cook together, push boundaries together. Past Edge City cohorts generated 
200+ projects, $1M+ grants, and lasting collaborations.
